# Movies-ETL
## Extract, Transform, and Load
The purpose of this analysis is to learn how to Extract, Transform, and Load data into PostgresSQL.  For this challenge we took several datasets, read them into a dataframe, and cleaned up the data to create a condensed format for easy analysis.  Once the data is ready, it is imported.  Screenshots of the 'movies' query and the 'ratings' query are provided below.
